# Typing trainer TUI
My very bad typing trainer implementation on python3 using curses module
## How to use
By default this program reads from words.txt file
Each line of file is considered a sentence to type
Sentences are choosen randomly
You can specify another file to read from by adding its path as an argument: 
`python3 trainer.py /path/to/file`

Or you can run it with default settings: 
`python3 trainer.py`
